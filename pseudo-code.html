For Google sheets:
(alphabetizing column of activities) )
=SORT($C$4:$C$37, 1, TRUE)
=SORT(INDIRECT(ADDRESS(4,COLUMN())):$E$37, 1, TRUE)
=SORT(INDIRECT(ADDRESS(4,COLUMN())):INDIRECT(ADDRESS(37,COLUMN())), 1, TRUE)


-----

- separate data in 'activites' section by '|'
- alphebetize activities arrays
- find co-occurance in activities arrays

When A occurs, how likely is it for B to occur?

or

How many times does A and B occur together?


//python dictionary:
dataset1 = {'date':'2019-05-11', 'monthDay':'May 11', 'weekday':'Saturday', 'mood': 'okay', 'activities': ['10k+','art','vacation','travel','friends']}
Activities1 = dataset1['activities']


ideas -- check for specific pairs first?
